## Trained Models
Due to GitHub file size limitations, the trained model files (.h5) are not included
in this repository.

The models can be:
- Generated by running the training scripts, or
- Provided separately for evaluation and live demonstration.

This repository focuses on the full implementation and execution logic
of the multimodal emotion recognition system.
